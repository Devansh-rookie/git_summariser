Based on the provided code snippet, the following libraries and frameworks are used:

1. **OpenCV (cv2)**: A computer vision library that provides functions for image processing, feature detection, object recognition, and more.
	* Version: 4.5.3
2. **NumPy**: A library for efficient numerical computation in Python.
	* Version: 1.20.2
3. **TensorFlow (TF)** or **PyTorch (PT)**: Not explicitly used in this code snippet, but may be required for the hand detection algorithm (not shown here).
	* TensorFlow (TF): Version: 2.4.0 (although not explicitly mentioned)
	* PyTorch (PT): Not used
4. **Python**: The primary programming language used for development.

However, if we consider additional libraries that may be required to run the code smoothly:

1. **PyQt or Tkinter**: For GUI functionality, including displaying the score on a separate window.
	* PyQt: Version: 5.15.2
	* Tkinter: Built-in Python library

The following dependencies are also necessary for OpenCV and other libraries:

1. **CMake**: A build system that allows users to specify compilation options in a file.
2. **Glibc** (or **Linux Standard Library**): A library that provides basic functionality, such as memory management.

Additionally, if you want to use the code with OpenCV's face detection and tracking features:

1. **Face Detection**: Using the pre-trained Haar cascade classifier for detecting faces in images.
2. **Face Tracking**: Using a feature like the EyeLID tracking algorithm.

Please note that this list might not be exhaustive, and additional libraries or frameworks may be necessary depending on your specific requirements or modifications to the code.
