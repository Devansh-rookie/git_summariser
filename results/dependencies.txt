The following libraries and frameworks are required to run this code:

1.  **OpenCV (cv2)**: This is a Python library used for computer vision tasks, including image and video processing.

2.  **NumPy**: While not strictly necessary, NumPy's array data type is often used in conjunction with OpenCV's image processing functions. However, the `cv2` library also supports standard Python arrays.

3.  **Matplotlib or Tkinter (for GUI)**: Although this code doesn't create a graphical user interface (GUI) by itself, it does display images and handle user input through GUI components like trackbars, which could be created using libraries such as Matplotlib's toolkit for creating static plots, figures, charts and graphs.

4.  **Pillow**: Pillow is an image processing library that provides an easy-to-use interface to open, manipulate, and save various types of images. Although OpenCV can handle a wide range of image formats, using Pillow can be more convenient in many cases.

5.  **Pygame (for collision detection)**: Pygame is a set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It allows you to create fully featured games and multimedia programs in the python language. The library includes a flexible event handling system, a complete windowing system, and support for sound, image, and video playback.

6.  **Custom Libraries (utils package)**: This code appears to have some custom libraries or packages that provide functionality like hand detection, ball movement, paddle movement, collision detection, scoring, etc. These would be separate projects or modules in the project structure, but their exact implementation details are not shown here.

Here is a more detailed dependency tree:

```bash
- main.py
  - utils/
    __init__.py
    hand_detection.py
    ball.py
    paddle.py
    collision.py
    constants.py
```

The `utils` directory would be the root of your project's library packages. The submodules (`hand_detection`, `ball`, `paddle`, etc.) provide specific functionalities for the game and would need to be implemented separately.

Please note that you should install these libraries via pip (Python package manager) with the following commands:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib pillow pygame
```

And then initialize them in your main script:

```python
import cv2

cv2.namedWindow('Hand Gesture Slider')
```
