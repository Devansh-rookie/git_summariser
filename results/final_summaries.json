{"Ball.py": "The Ball class in the Ball.py file represents a bouncing ball with properties like position, velocity, and radius, allowing for movement, drawing, speed increase, reset, and random direction change.", "Paddle.py": "This Python file defines a `Paddle` class representing a paddle object in a game, with methods for drawing and moving the paddle within frame boundaries.", "README.md": "I'm happy to help you with your request. However, I don't see an actual file provided. Could you please share the contents of the README.md file? I'll be happy to summarize it for you in 30 words.", "Score.py": "Score tracker class with methods to calculate scores, check for winners, and display current score on a frame.", "collision.py": "Collision detection is implemented for ball interactions with paddle edges and top/bottom bounds. Velocities are adjusted based on collisions to simulate realistic gameplay.", "constants.py": "Constants for a game set include window size (700x500), ball and paddle dimensions, colors, velocity, score maximum limit, and padding offsets with associated calculations.", "hand_detection.py": "This Python script is for hand detection using OpenCV. It creates a window with trackbars for adjusting the HSV color range, applies a mask to the frame, and then finds contours of the hands in the image, calculating their centroids for display.", "main.py": "This Python script initializes a video capture, detects hand gestures, controls paddles, moves a ball, displays score, and handles collisions using OpenCV."}
