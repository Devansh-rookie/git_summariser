{"Ball.py": "Ball class simulates a ball movement with speed increase, drawing and resetting its position. Speed changes randomly upon each reset, maintaining velocity direction.", "Paddle.py": "The Paddle class is a graphical representation with attributes x, y, width, height, and color. It has methods to draw the paddle on an image and move it within frame boundaries.", "README.md": "A virtual air hockey game with customizable players, teams, and rules, developed using Python, Pygame, and SQLite for database storage.", "Score.py": "Score.py is a Python class for tracking scores in a game. It updates scores based on ball position and displays the current score until a winner is determined, then resets the game.", "collision.py": "Collision detection in a game, handled by updating ball velocity upon collision with side or paddle edges, and resetting the ball's position when hitting the edge.", "constants.py": "Constants for game development, including window size (700x500), ball properties (radius 15, color white, velocity 2), paddle dimensions (20x100), padding offsets, and score limits (max 5).", "hand_detection.py": "This Python script implements hand detection using OpenCV. It creates a GUI with trackbars to adjust the HSV color range, then uses these settings to detect hands in real-time video from the webcam, highlighting the centroid of each detected hand on the frame.", "main.py": "Main program initializes camera, detects hand gestures, moves paddles, and displays score in a real-time game environment."}
