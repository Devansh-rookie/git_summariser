  "Ball.py": "The Ball class simulates a bouncing ball with increasing speed, resetting direction randomly at each reset and drawing itself on a frame using OpenCV.",
  "Paddle.py": "A Paddle class is defined with attributes x, y, color, and dimensions. It has methods for drawing on a frame, moving to new coordinates, and ensuring it stays within the frame boundaries.",
  "README.md": "A game written in Python using Pygame, aiming to replicate the experience of playing air hockey, with features like scoring and game logic.",
  "Score.py": "The Score class tracks player scores and determines a winner based on maximum score. It displays updated scores and declares a winner with a timeout display.",
  "collision.py": "Ball collides with paddles, resets or reverses velocity on sides, and increases speed when hitting paddles.",
  "constants.py": "Constants for game development, including window size, ball and paddle variables, offsets, score limits, and speed increments, defining the core elements of a game.",
  "hand_detection.py": "This Python script uses OpenCV to create a hand detection system. It allows users to adjust color thresholds for detected hands and finds the two largest contours in each frame, drawing circles around their centroids.",
  "main.py": "This script captures video from a camera, detects hand gestures to control paddles in a game, moves a ball on screen, displays score, and handles collisions between the ball and paddles."
