The provided C++ code project appears to utilize several libraries and frameworks. Based on the files and directories present in the repository, here are some of the notable ones:

**C++ Libraries:**

1. **Boost**: Boost is a comprehensive C++ library that provides various utility functions, containers, algorithms, and more. It's likely used for tasks such as logging, networking, and string manipulation.
2. **OpenSSL**: OpenSSL is a popular cryptographic library used for secure communication and encryption. It might be utilized for tasks like SSL/TLS protocol implementation or cryptographic hashing.
3. **Poco**: Poco is a C++ libraries and frameworks for building network-enabled applications. It provides a comprehensive set of libraries for networking, databases, XML parsing, and more.

**C++ Frameworks:**

1. **Qt**: Qt is a popular cross-platform application development framework that provides a comprehensive set of libraries and tools for building GUI applications, networks, and more.
2. **Eigen**: Eigen is a high-performance linear algebra library used for matrix operations, numerical computations, and other mathematical tasks.

**Other Dependencies:**

1. **CMake**: CMake is a cross-platform build system generator that provides a way to define build configurations, dependencies, and compilation options in a platform-independent manner.
2. **Make**: Make is a classic Unix-based build tool used for compiling and linking source code files into executable binaries.

**Other Tools:**

1. **GNOME Terminal**: GNOME Terminal is a terminal emulator application used to run the firewall, C analyzer, and Rust analyzer binaries in separate windows.
2. **xterm**: xterm is another terminal emulator application that might be used on some systems instead of GNOME Terminal.

Here's an example of how you could list these libraries and frameworks as dependencies for your project:

```bash
# Required libraries
boost
openssl
poco

# Required frameworks
qt
eigen

# Other dependencies
cmake
make

# Optional tools
gnome-terminal
xterm
```

Note that some of these dependencies might not be strictly required, and their usage might vary depending on the specific requirements of your project.
