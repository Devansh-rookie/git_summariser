Based on the code provided, here are the libraries and frameworks required:

**Required Libraries:**

1. **OpenCV (cv2)**: For image processing, computer vision tasks, and video capture.
2. **NumPy**: For efficient numerical computations and data storage.
3. **Pandas**: Not used explicitly in this code snippet, but may be required for data manipulation or analysis later on.

**Optional Libraries:**

1. **Pygame**: An alternative to OpenCV for display and game development.
2. **Pyglet**: Another alternative to Pygame for creating games with a more modern API.

**Other Tools and Resources:**

1. **Python Interpreter**: The code is written in Python, so you'll need to have the Python interpreter installed on your system.
2. **Video Capture Device**: The `cv2.VideoCapture` class requires a video capture device (e.g., webcam) to capture video frames.

**Frameworks and APIs:**

None explicitly mentioned in this code snippet. However, if you were to expand upon this project or create additional features, you might consider using frameworks like:

1. **Kivy**: A cross-platform Python library for building multi-touch applications.
2. **PyQt** or **PySide**: Qt-based Python libraries for building GUI applications.

Keep in mind that the specific libraries and frameworks required may vary depending on your project's requirements and goals.
